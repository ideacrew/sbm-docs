## Step 2

Once clicking the “Messages” tab, you (the CoverME.gov member) will be taken to the mailbox.  There are a number of action items/features that you have access to on this page.

_**Inbox**_

The **Inbox** is where all the Secure notifications automatically generated from the system are accessible by the user. The **Inbox** stores a hyperlink to the notice containing the sender, date of the notice, and subject of the notice.  All unread notices will be marked by a numerical indicator showing that the message has not been opened.

**Note:** Once the member open the message the numerical indicator will reduce by one (1), indicating that the message has been read.

The member has the ability to remove a message from your **Inbox** to the **Deleted** tab filter via the trash can icon next to the notice.
