## Step 4

Clicking “Continue” on this page will trigger the person lookup. If the person with the given combination of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) does not exist in the system you will see a green banner signaling that the person has been saved and tied to this given account. If a person already exists in the system with the given PII, an error message will appear prompting the consumer to sign in to their existing account. The platform utilizes the combination of SSN and Date of Birth (DOB) to validate uniqueness however if SSN is validly not present then it will utilize the combination of First Name, Last Name and DOB for a given account holder.

## Step 5

Clicking “Continue” on the “Personal Information” page once more will navigate the consumer to the “Tell Us About Yourself” section where further detail is gathered on the demographics of the account holder. This is where the applicant will enter the rest of their demographic information, citizenship/immigration status information, incarceration status, contact information, addresses, communication preferences, etc.

**NOTE:** If the consumer attempts to enter/save an address outside of the state of Maine they will be able to submit an application though may be deemed ineligible for QHP and QDP coverage.

## Step 6

Clicking “Continue” will navigate you to the “Authorization and Consent” page where the consumer is notified that we must verify their identity to complete the application for coverage. If the person selects “I Agree” then Experian will be called on the next page to verify the person’s identity. If the person selects “I Disagree” then the consumer will see a message appear stating that identity must be verified by an alternative route (paper application, document upload)

**Note:** If the user disagrees and clicks CONTINUE the user will be routed to the identity document upload screen in step 8 below with the ability to upload documentation for marketplace or CAC staff review & approval.

## Step 7

Clicking “Continue” will trigger the request for Experian data and navigate the account holder to the “Verify Identity” page where, the consumer will be presented a list of questions specific to their personal history.

**NOTE:** Below screenshot is using example presets.

## Step 8

Clicking “Submit” will trigger response submission to Experian. If Experian is able to verify the account holder’s identity using the user’s responses, the user will land on the “Your Application For Premium Reductions” page. If Experian is unable to verify the consumer’s identity using the security questions, the user will see the following page. This page states that Experian was unable to verify the consumer’s identity and that identity must be verified by an alternative option. This page outlines the options to the consumer (resubmit responses to Experian, document upload, apply in person, upload a paper application).

## Step 9

When a consumer uploads an identity document, the document status will move from “Outstanding” to “Review”. The consumer will still be unable to continue the application until the marketplace or CAC staff member has reviewed and approved the provided documentation.

## Step 10

Once the marketplace or CAC staff member has reviewed and approved the documentation, the consumer will see that the document status is moved to “Verified” and the Continue button is now enabled so that the consumer can continue their application.

## Step 11

Clicking “Continue” will navigate the consumer to the “Your Application for Premium Reductions” page. This page presents the question to the consumer on whether or not they would like to apply for assistance on their premium amounts (assistance application). Selecting “no” to this question will begin the “unassisted application” flow. Selecting “yes” to this question will begin the “assistance application flow”.
